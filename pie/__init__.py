"""pieEngine - Pygame Prototyping Engine




* You'll find that much of the code is done in ways that might not be
considered pythonic; e.g. the usage of private instance variables and
flat getters/settings. The goal for the author is to hopefully allow
these pieces to be more easily ported to strict, verbose and faster
languages like Java/libGDX.
